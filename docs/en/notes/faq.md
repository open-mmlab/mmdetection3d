## MMEngine/MMCV/MMDet/MMDet3D Installation

- Compatibility issue between MMEngine, MMCV, MMDetection and MMDetection3D; "ConvWS is already registered in conv layer"; "AssertionError: MMCV==xxx is used but incompatible. Please install mmcv>=xxx, \<=xxx."

- The required versions of MMEngine, MMCV and MMDetection for different versions of MMDetection3D are as below. Please install the correct version of MMEngine, MMCV and MMDetection to avoid installation issues.

  | MMDetection3D version |     MMEngine version     |      MMCV version       |   MMDetection version    |
  | --------------------- | :----------------------: | :---------------------: | :----------------------: |
  | dev-1.x               | mmengine>=0.7.1, \<1.0.0 | mmcv>=2.0.0rc4, \<2.1.0 |  mmdet>=3.0.0, \<3.1.0   |
  | main                  | mmengine>=0.7.1, \<1.0.0 | mmcv>=2.0.0rc4, \<2.1.0 |  mmdet>=3.0.0, \<3.1.0   |
  | v1.1.1                | mmengine>=0.7.1, \<1.0.0 | mmcv>=2.0.0rc4, \<2.1.0 |  mmdet>=3.0.0, \<3.1.0   |
  | v1.1.0rc3             | mmengine>=0.1.0, \<1.0.0 | mmcv>=2.0.0rc3, \<2.1.0 | mmdet>=3.0.0rc0, \<3.1.0 |
  | v1.1.0rc2             | mmengine>=0.1.0, \<1.0.0 | mmcv>=2.0.0rc3, \<2.1.0 | mmdet>=3.0.0rc0, \<3.1.0 |
  | v1.1.0rc1             | mmengine>=0.1.0, \<1.0.0 | mmcv>=2.0.0rc0, \<2.1.0 | mmdet>=3.0.0rc0, \<3.1.0 |

  **Note:** If you want to install mmdet3d-v1.0.0rcx, the compatible MMDetection, MMSegmentation and MMCV versions table can be found at [here](https://mmdetection3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#mmcv-mmdet-mmdet3d-installation). Please choose the correct version of MMCV, MMDetection and MMSegmentation to avoid installation issues.

- If you faced the error shown below when importing open3d:

  `OSError: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.27' not found`

  please downgrade open3d to 0.9.0.0, because the latest open3d needs the support of file 'GLIBC_2.27', which only exists in Ubuntu 18.04, not in Ubuntu 16.04.

- If you faced the error when importing pycocotools, this is because nuscenes-devkit installs pycocotools but mmdet relies on mmpycocotools. The current workaround is as below. We will migrate to use pycocotools in the future.

  ```shell
  pip uninstall pycocotools mmpycocotools
  pip install mmpycocotools
  ```

  **NOTE**: We have migrated to use pycocotools in mmdet3d >= 0.13.0.

- If you face the error shown below when importing pycocotools:

  `ValueError: numpy.ndarray size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 88 from C header, got 80 from PyObject`

  please downgrade pycocotools to 2.0.1 because of the incompatibility between the newest pycocotools and numpy \< 1.20.0. Or you can compile and install the latest pycocotools from source as below:

  `pip install -e "git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi#egg=pycocotools&subdirectory=PythonAPI"`

  or

  `pip install -e "git+https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/cocoapi#egg=pycocotools&subdirectory=PythonAPI"`

- If you face some errors about numba in cuda-9.0 environment, you should check the version of numba. In cuda-9.0 environment, the high version of numba is not supported and we suggest you could install numba==0.53.0.

## How to annotate point cloud?

MMDetection3D does not support point cloud annotation. Some open-source annotation tool are offered for reference:

- [SUSTechPOINTS](https://github.com/naurril/SUSTechPOINTS)
- [LATTE](https://github.com/bernwang/latte)

Besides, we improved [LATTE](https://github.com/bernwang/latte) for better use. More details can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10174).
