**News**: We released the codebase v0.8.0.

Documentation: https://mmdetection3d.readthedocs.io/

## Introduction

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3 to 1.6**.

MMDetection3D is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch, towards the next-generation platform for general 3D detection. It is
a part of the OpenMMLab project developed by [MMLab](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).

### Major features

- **Support multi-modality/single-modality detectors out of box**

  It directly supports multi-modality/single-modality detectors including MVXNet, VoteNet, PointPillars, etc.

- **Support indoor/outdoor 3D detection out of box**

  It directly supports popular indoor and outdoor 3D detection datasets, including ScanNet, SUNRGB-D, Waymo, nuScenes, Lyft, and KITTI.
  For nuScenes dataset, we also support nuImages dataset.

- **Natural integration with 2D detection**

  All the about **40+ methods, 300+ models**, and modules supported in [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/model_zoo.md) can be trained or used in this codebase.

- **High efficiency**

  It trains faster than other codebases. The main results are as below. Details can be found in [benchmark.md](./docs/benchmarks.md). We compare the number of samples trained per second (the higher, the better). The models that are not supported by other codebases are marked by `×`.

  | SECOND| 40           |30     |   ×      | ×    |
  | Part-A2| 17           |14     |   ×      | ×    |

Like [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv), MMDetection3D can also be used as a library to support different projects on top of it.
