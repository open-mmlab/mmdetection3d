**News**: We released the codebase v0.1.0.

Documentation: https://mmdetection3d.readthedocs.io/

## Introduction

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3 to 1.5**.

MMDetection3D is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch, towards the next generation toolbox for general 3D detection. It is
a part of the OpenMMLab project developed by [MMLab](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).

### Major features

- **Support multi-modality/single-modality detectors out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports multi-modality/single-modality detectors including MVXNet, VoteNet, PointPillars, etc.

- **Support indoor/outdoor 3D detection out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular indoor and outdoor 3D detection datasets, including ScanNet, SUNRGB-D, nuScenes, Lyft, and KITTI.

- **Natural integration with 2D detection**
  All the about **300 models, 40+ papers**, and modules supported in [MMDetection's model zoo](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/model_zoo.md) can be trained or used in this codebase.

- **High efficiency**

  The training and testing speed is [faster than other codebases](./docs/benchmarks.md).

Apart from MMDetection3D, we also released a library [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which are heavily depended on by this toolbox.

## Installation

Please refer to [install.md](docs/install.md) for installation and dataset preparation.


## Get Started

Please see [getting_started.md](docs/getting_started.md) for the basic usage of MMDetection. There are also tutorials for [finetuning models](docs/tutorials/finetune.md), [adding new dataset](docs/tutorials/new_dataset.md), [designing data pipeline](docs/tutorials/data_pipeline.md), and [adding new modules](docs/tutorials/new_modules.md).

## Contributing

We appreciate all contributions to improve MMDetection3D. Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contributing guideline.

## Acknowledgement

MMDetection3D is an open source project that is contributed by researchers and engineers from various colleges and companies. We appreciate all the contributors as well as users who give valuable feedbacks.
We wish that the toolbox and benchmark could serve the growing research community by providing a flexible toolkit to reimplement existing methods and develop their own new 3D detectors.
